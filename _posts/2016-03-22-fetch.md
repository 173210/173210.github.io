The answer is quite a simple: use Fetch API.

JavaScript is so powerful, especially on modern browsers such as Chrome.
It's always evolving, and providing solutions for its faults. I also encountered
a problem with JavaScript, but there's already one for the issue.

#XMLHTTPRequest
JavaScript already has a method to get contents on the Web. XMLHTTPRequest has
various options, and it's more generic than the name indicates: it can be used
for any data, and any protocol the browser supports. It's also possible to
modify headers with `setRequestHeader`.

However, XMLHTTPRequest sometimes brings unexpected results: the header contains
some variables specified by the browser, and some of them can't be removed.
In my case, `Cookie` header caused an error.

#Fetch API
Fetch API is new. The API is defined by [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/).
The specification is available on [https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),
but note that it's "living standard". The last update is on 18 March 2016.
The specification can be changed later.
[MDN provides information about browser compatiblity](https://developer.mozilla.org/ja/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
I recommend to refer the page before you use the API.

##Using Fetch API to Get the Bearer Token of Twitter
Fortunately, what I'm developing is a Chrome extension, and I don' have to
be bothered by browsers without Fecth API. I'll show the exact code of
my extension for a example.

```JavaScript
fetch("https://api.twitter.com/oauth2/token", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8",
		"Authorization": "Basic " + btoa(CONSUMER_KEY + ":" + CONSUMER_SECRET)
	},
	body: "grant_type=client_credentials"});
```

It's really simple, isn't it? The `Authorization` part may look redundant because
XMLHTTPRequest can set the header automatically by passing the credentials
as parameters for `open` or by including them to the URI. It's impossible for
now, but [the new standard of Fetch API has authorizationValue, a new variable for `Authorization`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-network-or-cache-fetch).
Stay tuned!
