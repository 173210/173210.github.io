I really, really got tired of taking care of it. It causes many problems with
the dirty hack, "calling itself". But you know, it's actually used in many projects.

```Makefile
	make -C $(BUILD) -f $(CURDIR)/Makefile
```

Why is the template used? The major feature of the template is to output objects
in a directory different from the one where source files are. The feature is
provided by automake or something kind of that, but we want to do that
only with Makefile. How can we do that? Google often solves any problems, but
in this case, I couldn't find a solution. So, I'll write code by myself.

Fortunately, the manual of GNU make provides a hint.

[GNU make: Prerequisite Types](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Prerequisite-Types.html)

> Consider an example where your targets are to be placed in a separate directory

```Makefile
OBJDIR := objdir
OBJS := $(addprefix $(OBJDIR)/,foo.o bar.o baz.o)

$(OBJDIR)/%.o : %.c
        $(COMPILE.c) $(OUTPUT_OPTION) $<

all: $(OBJS)

$(OBJS): | $(OBJDIR)

$(OBJDIR):
        mkdir $(OBJDIR)
```

It looks nice, but it can't generate multiple directories. To solve the problem,
I use _foreach_, _eval_, and _dir_.

```Makefile
$(foreach f,$(BUILD) $(PATCHES) $(PAYLOAD_OBJS),$(eval $f : | $(dir $f)))

%/:
	mkdir -p $@
```

Probably you don't need an explanation for _foreach_. In _eval_, each content
will be evaluated as a independent sentence. _dir_ will return the directory
with "/" suffix. The meaning is clear: it allows to make a generic rule.

Although (GNU) make is difficult to use, it is really powerful. The world of
make may be broader than you think.
