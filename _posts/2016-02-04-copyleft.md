Recently I had an interview for a part-time job of programming. The interviewers
told me that I can own the copyright and license under any open source license,
even any copyleft licenses such as _GPL_, I mainly use. However, they also said
non-copyleft licenses are preferred for the educational (academic) purpose.

The copyleft license is egoistic. RMS, who invented copyleft, intended to "free"
softwares by restricting proprietary use. However, the copyleft license is also
useful for proprietary. _Qt_ is a well known example. I also use the copyleft
license for my own purpose: to improve my work by including changes made by
others.

RMS and his supporters may claim softwares should not be owned by someone, but
it's so natural that people claim their rights for their work. They blame owners
of proprietary softwares, but it's too hasty to determine any proprietary works
are bad.

Academic works are to prove the scientific truth and their use should not be
restricted. I know that, but I don't think copyright limits any further
investigation for the research itself, and should be preserved.
