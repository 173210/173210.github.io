I'm a bit tired of reversing `fake_package_installer`, so I note how I'm doing
that.

# Dumping modules
Though we (probably) don't have any mean to decrypt modules, we can dump modules
decrypted and loaded by `sceKernelLoadModule`. HENkaku seems to have removed
privilege checks of `sceKernelLoadModule` and we can load most of user-mode
modules.

`vitadump` is a userful tool to dump with the trick. For convenience, I have
added features to dump `SceKernelModuleInfo` and save program segments to ELF.

# Old Good PrxTool
PrxTool is a reverse-engineering tool for PSP modules. It shows data-references,
cross-references, and APIs. It's super neat, but it should be difficult to make
a complete alternative for PS Vita.

xyzz's solution is to use _IDA Pro_ with [his plugin which is also named `vitadump`](https://github.com/xyzz/vitadump). That should be nice, but _IDA Pro_ is
stupidly expensive and I cannot afford to buy one.

Instead, I used [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2). Though it also
provides a flexible plugin support, it is a bit buggy and I'm not sure it would
be the best tool in the future. Eventually I developed a generic tool.

It should work with any tools which can handle ELF. With a few other bug fixes
for radare2, I got a nice environment to reverse PS Vita modules.
