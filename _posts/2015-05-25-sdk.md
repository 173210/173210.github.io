#Sumary
Yifan Lu is making a SDK for PS Vita. To get a hint to make it better, I'll
point out important things for SDK.

SDK should have the following feature:

* Simple

* Compatibility (with POSIX and old generations)

They allows to make a SDK which can be used for any purpose anytime.

#Introduction
Today, PS Vita and 3DS homebrew scene is on active development. To make the
scenes better, I'll consider what is important for SDK referring the following
SDKs.

* PSPSDK
PSP homebrew scene is concerened as a great success. Most homebrew authors
thinks PSPSDK is one of the reason. For example, Yifan Lu is referring PSPSDK
to callã€€developers to join his SDK development.

[Yifan Lu | Calling all coders: We need you to help create an open Vita SDK!](http://yifan.lu/2015/05/23/calling-all-coders-we-need-you-to-help-create-an-open-vita-sdk/)

I'll consider why PSPSDK is so great.

* devkitARM (in devkitPro)
devkitARM is used for the development of Nitendo GBA/DS/3DS which has ARM CPU.
It is used for many consoles, but it's not more succeful than PSPSDK. I'll
point out its merits and demerits.

#PSPSDK
PSPSDK has some features which allows coder to write a program easily. Some
of them come from API of PSP implemented by SCE. Actually, SDK on proprietary
software is bound to API. So the quality of SDK does not correspond developers'
skills. However, PSPSDK has unique features.

This part refers to a sample in PSPSDK:

 */
#include <pspkernel.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/* Define the module info section */
PSP_MODULE_INFO("template", 0, 1, 1);

/* Define the main thread's attribute value (optional) */
PSP_MAIN_THREAD_ATTR(THREAD_ATTR_USER | THREAD_ATTR_VFPU);

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	printf("Hello World\n");

	return 0;
}
```
```Makefile
TARGET = template
OBJS = main.o

BUILD_PRX=1

INCDIR = 
CFLAGS = -O2 -G0 -Wall
CXXFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -fno-exceptions -fno-rtti
ASFLAGS = $(CFLAGS)

LIBDIR =
LDFLAGS =

PSPSDK=$(shell psp-config --pspsdk-path)
include $(PSPSDK)/lib/build.mak
```

##POSIX
As you can see, it has a compatibility with POSIX. PSPSDK offers several libc
with API of PSP. Thanks to API of PSP which is similar to POSIX, those libraries
can offer most standard functions. It allows to port softwares easily. As a
instance, Snes9x with many POSIX functions has been ported easily.

##Compact Code
Its overhead code is only 4 lines (PSP\_MODULE\_INFO and PSP\_MAIN\_THREAD\_ATTR)
That's amazing. It means that a software without hardware dependencies can be
ported just by adding 4 lines.

##Makefile
PSPSDK offers several files which enable to write Makefile easily. At a glance,
they may be useful to write Makefile. Actually, those features are used by many
applications. However, some of them can cause a comatibility problem. I'll show
some of them.

###psp-config
PSPSDK has their unique applications written in C language. psp-config is one of
them. But the dominant usage is setting of PSPSDK variable. The application
reduces portability only for that.

###build.mak
build.mak seems useful because it allows to build executable file (EBOOT.PBP
or prx) only by defining objects and TARGET. But build.mak restricts developers
and causes compatibility issues.

As you can see, the Makefile doesn't specify targets (_not_ TARGET). It means
the Makefile can't offer several targets. Some applications like HBL which
specifies several targets can't use build.mak.

Its compatibility issues can be shown by the large memory support and
PrxEncryptor support. Some developers has modified to support them and
lost their build.mak compatibility.

The solution of the issues is easy: remove the target definitions. But it will
lose its usability. Something like build.mak should _not_ be used.

##Conclution of This Part
The best PSPSDK's advantage is this: the usability. Even you don't have any
knowledge of PSP, you can write code. But even a great things has its
disadvantages. It should be more compact to improve the portability and
compatibility

#devkitARM
devkitARM is great in the point that it can be used for many devices. The
feature keeps older devices up-to-date. For example, you can use LTO (Link Time
Optimization) function which is introduced by 4.6 and still high development.
However, devkitARM is not more successful than PSPSDK, as I wrote. I'll point
out the issues.

##Share of libc
It disables to implement device-dependencies. The problem is clear. You can't
use functions like fopen.

##Complex
Let's see the list of repositories...
[devkitPro (GitHub)](https://github.com/devkitPro)

* builscripts

* libogc

* 3dstools

* nds-examples

* ndstool

* dslink

* install-dsilink

* libnds

* dswifi

* libfat

* filesystem

* default-arm7

* newlib

* nds-hb-menu

* gamecube-examples

* wii-examples

* libgba

* libmirko

* gp32-tools

* gp32-examples

* maxmod

* wiiload

* gba-tools

* general-tools

* mmutil

* gba-examples

* grit

* gamecube-tools

* 3ds_portlibs

* installer

* libnds-master

Too complex. Even if you have knowledges of GBA, you can't use the knowledges.
Neither contents have consistency.

The libraries include unnecessary parts and it makes itself too complex and
produce overheads. For example, let's see decompress.c in libnds.

	}
}
```
It doesn't seem necessary. It's more easier to call SWI directly. libnds has
many similar functions.

##Conclusion of This Part
It's clear that the complexity and lacks of compatibility make it difficult to
use them. However, many people use it because it support many devices.

#Conclution of this article
Those examples show what is important for SDK. To make a SDK, it is necessary
to be aware of them because anybody can make mistakes and they will be left as
they are.
