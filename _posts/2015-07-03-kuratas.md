#Notice
It's a translation of [an article in a blog](http://monkeyfarm.cocolog-nifty.com/nandemo/2015/07/post-ff62.html)
written by [Kogoro Kurata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCxbD67WhGc), a man
who made a huge robot named [_KURATAS_](http://suidobashijuko.jp/). This
translation is a crap, but should be better than Google Translation.

#Body
hi.

some seems excited...

I had notice in comments on this blog.

Americans are great, as I expected.

But let me say one thing before considering the challenge.

What have Japanese guys done in the last 4 years?

In such a case, it should be the right way that Japan robots fights with each
other and the winner has a duel with Americans or someone overseas. It's really
a shame that other Japanese guys hesitated to create the second one before
Americans do. I'm really disappointed.

Megabots, wait a moment while I consider the challenge.
