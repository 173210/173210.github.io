#Why CC-BY-SA?
Because I likes copyleft licenses. I do __NOT__ want others to license
derivations of my works under nonsense licenses such as one which promotes
communism by restricting any commercial use.

#Why not GFDL?
GFDL is also copyleft. But it's too troublesome to use. Google for the detail.

#The part of this blog which will be licensed under CC-BY-SA
_\_posts_ directory, misc.md and compiled forms of those works.
