Meaning is a multifaced phenomenon. Especially it has two faces:
__information content__ and __mental representation__.

# Information content
Meaning carries the following information:

* referring something (__the reference of the symbol__)
* relating several things

# Mental representation
Meaning is a mental representation which is:

* processed in minds
* constructs a mental lexicon

# Lexical semantics v.s. compositional semantics
* Lexical semantics is limited by the number of words;
compositional semantics is not.

* Lexical semantics is consciously acquired; compositional semantics is not.
