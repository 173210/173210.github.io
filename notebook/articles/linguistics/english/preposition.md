title: "English Grammar: Preposition"
---
In this page, I will introduce a concept for prepositions different from what
textbooks for English learners and dictionaries. Though the concept is not
known well, it is popular in linguistics [citation needed]. The idea was
introduced in [_The Philosophy of Grammar_](http://arrow.latrobe.edu.au:8080/vital/access/manager/Repository/latrobe:34351)

# Prepositions traditionally understood

* With NP as complement
* Prepositions can inflect in some rare cases (e.g. _near_)
* Prepositions can function as:  
  a complement of be, a lexical verb, or a noun  
  a modifier of a noun  
  an adjunct

# Extending the category
Though the traditional understanding looks like fine,
__it can be extended to be consistent with the definition of verbs__.

Prepositions may have complements as verbs do:

* NP as complement
* clause as complement, which was understood as for __conjuctions__
* no complement, which was understood as for __adverbs__

The new concept of preposition is no longer _pre_position!

# New prepositions
Here some new prepositions for example:

1. Prepositions that don't normally take complements: _here_, _abroad_, etc.
2. Prepositions that take clauses as complements: _because_, _although_, etc.
3. Prepositions that take PPs as complements: _because_, _ahead_, etc.

# Grammaticized use of prepositions
Prepositions can be required syntactically, but a tiny number of other
individual words are only used for grammatical purposes.

# Prepositions v.s. adjectives
The status of small number of words such as _worth_ and _like_ are anomalous.
However, the majority of prepositions and adjectives have the followin
difference:

* Adjectives don't license NP complements; many prepositions do.
* Many adjectives inflect; prepositions do not.
* Most adjectives are gradable with words such as very, but some of them do not
work for prepositions in general.
* AdjP as adjunct needs a predicand, but PP as adjunct doesn't.
* AdjP can be a complement for _become_; PP often does not.

# Prepositions v.s. adverbs
Some of what were considered as adverbs are prepositions which don't need a
complement. It allows to limit "adverb" to a modifer of a verb, adjective, or
adverb.

See _A Students' Introduction to English Grammar_, page 130-132 for other
various reasons.

# Prepositions v.s. subordinates
We should call what is called subordinating conjuctions __subordinates__.
Because the category of prepositions is extended, there should be few
subordinates (e.g. _that_, _to_, _whether_, and _if_).

# Prepositions v.s. verbs
Gerand-participles and past-participles can be prepositions.
