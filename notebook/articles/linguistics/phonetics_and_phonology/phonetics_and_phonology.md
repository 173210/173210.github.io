# Phonetics v.s. Phonology?
Both of them describes speech sounds or signs (phones).

## Phonetics
### Concrete
Phonetics provides how actually phones are.

### Form
Phonetics is concerned with articulation, perception and physical properties.

## Phonology
### Abstract
Phonology provides the minimal regularities. It is similar to grammar.

### Function
Phonology is concerned with phones' representations and systematic behavior.

# Allophones v.s. Phonemes
A pair of phonemes are completely distinct (i.e. they can form a
__minimal pair__). On the other hand, allophones may be representations for one
phoneme.

# Segement
__Segment__: A discrete unit (e.g. phoneme)  
__Suprasegment__: A unit which belongs words rather than a phonetic segment
(e.g. stress, rhythm, and intonation)
