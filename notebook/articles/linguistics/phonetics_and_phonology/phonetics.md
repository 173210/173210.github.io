# Segement
__Segment__: A discrete unit (e.g. phoneme)  
__Suprasegment__: A unit which belongs words rather than a phonetic segment
(e.g. stress, rhythm, and intonation)

## Phoneme
Human speech apparatus and the hearing mechanism limits the number of
phonemes. (200-300 phonemes v.s. 5000-8000 languages)

Phonemes are consisted of vowels and consonants. The following is the definition
of them. (Roach, 2005, p.17)

### Vowels (vocoids)
"Sounds which do not obstruct airflow" (e.g. /a e i o u/)

### Consonants
"Sounds which obstruct the airflow" (e.g. /p t k s f r w/)

# Voicing
* Air source: Lungs
* Buzzer: Larynx
* Resonator (filter): Mouth (vocal tract)

([_Make your own vowel resonators!_](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/mark/vowels/),
Mark Huckvale, 2008)

They change different properties of vocal sounds.

## Larynx
* Quality of voice (phonation)
* Loudness (amplitude)
* Pitch (fundamental frequency)
* Voiced v.s. voiceless

## Vocal tract
* Articulation (manner and place)

The vocal tract makes formants.

# The components of sound

## Waveform

### Periodic
Periodic sounds repeats a pattern, which can be either simple (e.g. sine) or
complex (e.g. human voice).
Complex patterns can also be expressed with compositions of simple patterns
(__harmonics__).

### Aperiodic
Aperiodic sounds doesn't repeat any pattern (e.g. noises)

## Frequency
Frequency determines the __pitch__. Frequency is the number of repetitions in a
particular period and the common unit is Hertz (Hz), which is the number of
repetitions of cycles per second.

## Amplitude
Amplitude determins the __loudness__. Amplitude is the amount of force applied.

## Formant
Formant is a harmonic which are augmented.
