The financial system has many actors, including companies, banks, and
governments. This page describes them.

# Banks
Banks can be classified to commercial ones and investment ones.  
This page uses a comparsion easy for me.

## Commercial Banks
Role: storage servers  
Power: interest  
I/O: deposit/loans  
Networking: transactions

## Investment Banks
Role: balancer  
Power: the margin of the transactions, divend, interest and payback  
I/O: selling/buying stock/securities  
Networking: networks centralized with stock/securities exchanges
