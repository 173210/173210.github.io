Political theory is similar to political philosophy. In this page I assume they
are same thing. For further details, google.

# Political Science v.s. Political Theory
Political science is an empirical and descriptive study.  
Political theory concerns ethnical or normative questions.

Political science founds issues in the real world, and political theory provides
answers for them.

# The elements of political theory

Political theory concerns:

* Concepts (e.g. justice, liberty, human rights, and equality)
* Theories (e.g. social contract theory and utilitrarian theory)
* Ideologies (e.g. liberalism, conservatism, libertarianism)
