title: Japanese Politics and Political Economy
---
# Why Japanese Politics!?
Because it's so unique.

## Weak Democracy?
Japanese politics has been dominated by one party, the Liberal Democratic Party.
(自民党) It has experienced few and short regime changes (the Hosokawa Regime
and the Democratic Party Regime)

## Rapid Resurrection after World War II
Though Japan experienced World War II, Japan rapidly reconstructed its economy
after World War II and it grew even so that some calls _Japan As Number One_.
