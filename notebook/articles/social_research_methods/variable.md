title: "Social Research Methods: Variable"
---
Variable is anything that varies; has multiple values.

# Dependency
## Independent variable
Other variable can depend on independent variables. In the case, they are
the _causes_.

## Dependent variable
The _effect_ of the varaibles which the dependent variable depends on.

# Relationship
* Linear (positive or negative)
* Curvilinear
* Nothing

## Studying relationship
### Non-experimental method
Behavior is observed as it naturally occurs.

It allows to observe the real world. Sometimes it is possible to observe in
a more macro scale, which is useful to evaluate predictions.

### Experimental method
All variables are controlled by concious and random assignment.

It allows to infer causuality:

* The problems of inferring cause and effect can be addressed.
* Variables which a specfic varible depends on can be identified.

Experimental method is more restricted by ethics.
